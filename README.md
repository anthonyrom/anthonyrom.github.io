# startpage
My personal, simple, minimal new tab/startpage. Basically stripped down version of [Tilde](https://github.com/cadejscroggins/tilde)


-------------

Just putting this repository up in case anyone wants a super simple and sleek looking startpage. I took the awesome work done on Tilde, stripped out the Javascript clock, HTML aside drawer, and site search functionality. I removed this extra functionality just because I wouldn't use it anyway personally. I updated the colors to fit my computer's overall Base16 Ocean Dark theme, but that's it. This is just a search box that you assign to your favorite search engine and have active when you open a new tab.


Truly, it's useless. It's just a search bar. But I like how it looks, so whatever.
